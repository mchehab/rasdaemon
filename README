RAS Daemon
==========

Those tools provide a way to get Platform Reliability, Availability
and Serviceability (RAS) reports made via the Kernel tracing events.

GOALS
=====

Its initial goal is to replace the edac-tools that got bitroted after
the addition of the HERM (Hardware Events Report Method )patches[1] at
the EDAC Kernel drivers.

[1] http://lkml.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/1205.1/02075.html

Its long term goal is to be the userspace tool that will collect all
hardware error events reported by the Linux Kernel from several sources
(EDAC, MCE, PCI, ...) into one common framework.

It is not meant to provide tools for doing error injection, as there are
other tools already covering it, like:
	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gong.chen/mce-test.git

Yet, a few set of testing scripts are provided under /contrib dir.

When the final version of the HERM patches was merged upstream, it was
decided to not expose the memory error counters to userspace.
This is one of the differences from what it was provided by edac-utils, as
EDAC 2.0.0 exports errors via a set of sysfs nodes that sums the amount of
errors per DIMM, per memory channel and per memory controller.
However, those counters are monotonically increased, and there's no way to
detect if they're very sparsed in time, if the occurrence is increasing over
time, or if they're due to some burst, perhaps due to a Solar Storm hitting
the ionosphere.

In other words, the rationale for not exposing such the information is that:

	1) can be easily accounted on userspace;

	2) they're not really meaningful. E. g. one system with, let's say
10 corrected errors can be fine, while another one with the same amount
of errors can have problems, as the error counters don't take into
account things like system uptime, memory error bursts (that could be
caused by a solar storm, for example), etc.

So, the idea since them was to make the kernel-userspace interface
simpler and move the policy to the userspace daemon. It is up to the
userspace daemon to correlate the data about the RAS events and provide
the system administrator a comprehensive report, presenting him
a better hint if he needs to contact the hardware vendor to replace
a component that is working degraded, or to simply discard the error.

So, the approach taken here is to allow storing those errors on a SQLite
database, in order to allow those data to be latter mining.

It is currently not part of the scope to do sophiscicated data mininy
analysis, as that would require enough statistitical data about hardware
MTBF. In other words, an abnormal component that needs to be replaced
shoud be statistically compared with a similar component that operates
under a normal condition. To do such checks, the analysis tool would
need to know the probability density function(p. d. f.) of that component,
and its rellevant parameters (like mean and standard derivation, if the
p. d. f. funcion is a Normal distribution).

While this tool works since Kernel 3.5 (where HERM patches got added),
in order to get the full benefit of this tool, Kernel 3.10 or upper is
needed.

COMPILING AND INSTALLING
========================

sqlite3 and autoconf needs to be installed. On Fedora, this is done
by installing the following packages:
	make
	gcc
	autoconf
	automake
	libtool
	tar
	sqlite-devel	(if sqlite3 will be used)

To install then on Fedora, run:
	yum install -y make gcc autoconf automake libtool tar

Or, if sqlite3 database will be used to store data:
	yum install -y make gcc autoconf automake libtool tar sqlite-devel

There are currently 3 features that are enabled optionally, via
./configure parameters:

  --enable-sqlite3        enable storing data at SQL lite database (currently
                          experimental)
  --enable-aer            enable PCIe AER events (currently experimental)
  --enable-mce            enable MCE events (currently experimental)

In order to compile it, run:
	$ autoreconf -vfi
	$ ./configure [parameters]
	$ make

So, for example, to enable everything but sqlite3:

	$ autoreconf -vfi && ./configure --enable-aer --enable-mce && make

After compiling, run, as root:
	# make install

COMPILING AND INSTALLING
========================

If the distribution is rpm-based, an alternative method would be to do:
	$ autoreconf -vfi && ./configure

The above procedure will generate a file at misc/rasdaemon.spec.

You may edit it, in order to add/remove the --enable-[option]
parameters.

To generate the rpm files, do:

	$ make dist-rpm

To install the rpm files, run, as root:
	# rpm -i `rpm --eval %{_topdir}`/RPMS/x86_64/rasdaemon-0.*.fc18.x86_64.rpm

RUNNING
=======

The daemon generally requires root permission, in order to read the
needed debugfs trace nodes, with needs to be previously mounted.
The rasdaemon will check at /proc/mounts where the debugfs partition
is mounted and use it while running.

To run the rasdaemon in background, just call it without any parameters:

	# rasdaemon

The output will be available via syslog. Or, to run it in foreground and see
the logs in console, run it as:
	# rasdaemon -f

or, if you also want to record errors at the database (--enable-sqlite3 is
required):
	# rasdaemon -f -r

You may also start it via systemd:
	# systemctl start rasdaemon

The rasdaemon will then output the messages to journald.

TESTING
=======

A script is provided under /contrib, in order to test the daemon EDAC
handler. While the daemon is running, just run:
	# contrib/edac-fake-inject

The script requires a Kernel compiled with CONFIG_EDAC_DEBUG and a running
EDAC driver.

MCE error handling can use the MCE inject:
	http://git.kernel.org/cgit/utils/cpu/mce/mce-inject.git
For it to work, Kernel mce-inject module should be compiled and loaded.

APEI error injection can use this tool:
	https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/gong.chen/mce-test.git/

AER error injection can use this tool:
	https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/gong.chen/aer-inject.git/
