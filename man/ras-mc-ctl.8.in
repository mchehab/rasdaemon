.TH RAS-MC-CTL 8 "@META_DATE@" "@META_ALIAS@" "RAS memory controller admin utility"

.SH NAME
ras-mc-ctl \- RAS memory controller admin utility

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ras-mc-ctl
[\fIOPTION\fR]...

.SH DESCRIPTION

The \fBras-mc-ctl\fR program is a \fBperl\fR(1) script which performs
some useful RAS administration tasks on EDAC (Error Detection and Correction)
drivers.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "--help"
Display a brief usage message.
.TP
.BI "--mainboard"
Print mainboard vendor and model for this hardware, if available.
The method used by \fBras-mc-ctl\fR to obtain the mainboard vendor
and model information for the current system is described below
in the \fIMAINBOARD CONFIGURATION\fR section.
.TP
.BI "--status"
Print the status of EDAC drivers (loaded or unloaded).
.TP
.BI "--quiet"
Be less verbose when executing an operation.
.TP
.BI "--register-labels"
Register motherboard DIMM labels into EDAC driver sysfs files.
This option uses the detected mainboard manufacturer and model
number in combination with a "labels database" found in any
of the files under @sysconfdir@/ras/dimm_labels.d/* or in the labels.db file
at @sysconfdir@/ras/dimm_labels.db. An entry for the current hardware must
exist in the labels database for this option to do anything.
.TP
.BI "--print-labels"
Display the configured labels for the current hardware, as
well as the current labels registered with EDAC.
.TP
.BI "--guess-labels"
Print DMI labels, when bank locator is available in the DMI table.
It helps to fill the labels database at @sysconfdir@/ras/dimm_labels.d/.
.TP
.BI "--labeldb="DB
Specify an alternate location for the labels database.
.TP
.BI "--delay="time
Specify a delay of \fBtime\fR seconds before registering DIMM labels.
Only meaninful if used together with --register-labels.
.TP
.BI "--layout"
Prints the memory layout as detected by the EDAC driver. Useful to check
if the EDAC driver is properly detecting the memory controller architecture.
.TP
.BI "--summary"
Presents a summary of the logged errors.
.TP
.BI "--errors"
Shows the errors stored at the error database.
.TP
.BI "--error-count"
Shows the corrected and uncorrected error counts using sysfs.
.TP
.BI "--vendor-errors-summary="platform-id
Pressents a summary of the vendor-specific logged errors.
.TP
.BI "--vendor-errors="platform-id
Shows the vendor-specific errors stored in the error database.
.TP
.BI "--vendor-platforms"
Shows the supported platforms with platform-ids for the vendor-specific errors.

.SH MAINBOARD CONFIGURATION
.PP
The \fBras-mc-ctl\fR script uses the following method to determine the
current system's mainboard vendor and model information:

.IP "1." 4
If the config file @sysconfdir@/edac/mainboard exists, then it is
parsed by \fBras-mc-ctl\fR. The mainboard config file has the following
simple syntax:
.nf

       vendor = <mainboard vendor string>
       model =  <mainboard model string>
       script = <script to gather mainboard information>

.fi
Where anything after a '#' character on a line is considered a comment.
If the keyword \fBscript\fR is specified, then that script or
executable is run by \fBras-mc-ctl\fR to gather the mainboard vendor
and model information. The script should write the resulting information
on stdout in the same format as the mainboard config file.

.IP "2."
If no mainboard config file exists, then \fBras-mc-ctl\fR will attempt
to read DMI information from the sysfs files
.nf

     /sys/class/dmi/id/board_vendor
     /sys/class/dmi/id/board_name

.fi

.IP "3."
If the sysfs files above do not exist, then \fBras-mc-ctl\fR will fall
back to parsing output of the \fBdmidecode\fR(8) utility. Use of this
utility will most often require that \fBras-mc-ctl\fR be run as root.
